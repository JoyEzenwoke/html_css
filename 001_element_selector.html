            <h1> The Solar System </h1>
            
            <h2> Mercury</h2>
            
            <p>Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest in our solar system. It has no atmosphere to speak of, which means it can’t trap heat—so temperatures swing from scorching hot during the day to freezing at night. Despite its closeness to the Sun, it's not the hottest planet. </p>
            <p>The surface of Mercury is rocky and full of craters, much like our Moon. </p>
            <p>Mercury has a very fast orbit around the Sun, completing one revolution in just 88 Earth days.  </p>

            <h3>Venus </h3>
            <br>
            <p> Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is often called Earth's sister because of their similar size and composition.</p>
            <p>Venus is incredibly hostile, with surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead due to a thick atmosphere full of carbon dioxide.</p>
            <p>Venus rotates very slowly and in the opposite direction of most planets.  </p>

            <h4>Earth </h4>
            <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known planet to support life. It has a breathable atmosphere, liquid water, and temperatures that allow for diverse ecosystems </p>
            <p>Its magnetic field protects us from harmful solar radiation. </p>
            <p>The planet is about 71% water and has one natural satellite—the Moon </p>

            <h5>Mars </h5>
            <br>
            <p>Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun, is often called the "Red Planet" because of its reddish appearance due to iron oxide (rust) on its surface. </p>
            <p>Although it's much colder than Earth, Mars has seasons, polar ice caps, and weather patterns. </p>
            <p>Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos. Future missions aim to send humans there, with hopes of building a sustainable outpost.</p>

            <h6>Jupiter </h6>
            <br>
            <p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in our solar system. It's a gas giant, mostly made of hydrogen and helium, with no solid surface. </p>
            <p>The planet has a very strong magnetic field and over 90 known moons, including the four largest—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto—called the Galilean moons. </p>
            <p>Jupiter's immense gravity helps protect the inner planets by capturing or deflecting comets and asteroids.</p>

            <h2> Summary </h2>
            <div>The solar system is made up of the Sun and all the celestial bodies that orbit it, including planets, moons, asteroids, and comets. Among the main planets, five stand out for their unique features and roles in space exploration. These planets differ in size, composition, atmosphere, and potential to support life  Some planets are rocky and Earth-like, while others are gas giants with powerful magnetic fields and many moons.</div>
