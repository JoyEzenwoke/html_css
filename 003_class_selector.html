    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Philosophy of science is the branch of philosophy concerned with the foundations, methods, and implications of science. Amongst its central questions are the difference between science and non-science, the reliability of scientific theories, and the ultimate purpose and meaning of science as a human endeavour.</p>

    <h4>Defining Science </h4>
    <div>
        <div id="explaination">
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philosophers have long attempted to define what counts as science. </p>

            <h3>Scientific Explaination</h3>
            <P>A closely related question is what counts as a good scientific explanation. In addition to providing predictions about future events, society often takes scientific theories to provide explanations for events that occur regularly or have already occurred. Philosophers have investigated the criteria by which a scientific theory can be said to have successfully explained a phenomenon, as well as what it means to say a scientific theory has explanatory power.</P>

        <h1>Philosophy of particular sciences</h1>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>In addition to addressing the general questions regardin science and induction, many philosophers of science are occupied by investigating foundational problems in particular sciences. They also examine the implications of particular sciences for broader philosophical questions. The late 20th and early 21st century has seen a rise in the number of practitioners of philosophy of a particular science.

         <h2> Conclusion </h2>
        <div id="continuation">
            <p class="conclusion">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The philosophy of science plays a vital role in deepening our understanding of what science is, how it operates, and why it matters. It challenges us to look beyond facts and experiments, encouraging critical thinking about the assumptions, methods, and values that underlie scientific practice.</p>
